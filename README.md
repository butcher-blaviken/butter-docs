# ðŸŒˆ About Butter Network

### Why does Interoperability matter?

1. **Scalability**: Interoperability allows different blockchain networks to communicate with each other, enabling the scaling of blockchain applications. Without interoperability, each blockchain operates in isolation, limiting the potential scalability of the entire ecosystem.
2. **Enhanced functionality**: Interoperability enables the exchange of assets and data between different blockchains. This allows for more complex functionalities and applications, such as cross-chain transactions, atomic swaps, and decentralized exchanges.
3. **Ecosystem growth**: Interoperability fosters collaboration and synergy within the blockchain ecosystem. It allows developers to leverage the strengths of multiple blockchains and create innovative solutions that benefit from the unique features of each platform. This, in turn, attracts more participants to the ecosystem and drives its growth.
4. **Combined Liquidity**: It consolidates liquidity from various networks, improving market efficiency and reducing slippage for traders.

### **What is the Butter Network?**

Butter is an **Omnichain Interoperability Hub** integrated with **ZK technology** that enables users with global DAPP accessibility and data availability, building an infrastructure that makes transactions transverse across chain to chain freely and securely.
